Profile

A former Senior Recruitment Consultant who is seeking a new challenging career after many years
of working within technology recruitment markets, I am keen to build upon this knowledge and
continue to learn within this sector, specifically development and applications. I am a hardworking
individual who strives to achieve the best in all areas with focus on building relationships with both
customer and stakeholder to deliver a successful service. As a self motivated individual, I am keen to
follow my dream within this new industry having finished the intensive 16 week full stack
development course at Makers Academy.
